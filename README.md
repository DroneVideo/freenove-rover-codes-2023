#### Square.py #####
In this script, we create a Motor object and define the duty cycle for each wheel to move in a square. 
We then use a for loop to move the rover forward and turn left for each side of the square. 
To turn left, we rotate the motors using the setMotorModel function. 
Finally, we stop the rover by setting the duty cycle of all motors to 0.
